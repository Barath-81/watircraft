Known Bugs

* Context for cucumber steps (SITE) is not quite the same as that for
  rspec tests or the console (START). Namely, you have direct access to site
  methods in cucumber, but not elsewhere. It would be easy to make cucumber
  more like the others but this could break existing test suites.
* Support for FireWatir is incomplete (specifically: Page fields)
* Page fields do not support Radio lists.
* Need to provide homepage for project.

Reported Bugs which we can't reproduce

* "Couldn't find 'site' generator" when running watircraft command.
  (using 0.3.1, neither taza nor watircraft-beta is also installed)
