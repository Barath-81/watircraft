Known Bugs

* The name of the element underlying each field is not consistent. In pages,
  it is called foo_field; in tables, foo_element. (Should probably be
  foo_element in both places.)
* Page fields are not supported for Firefox.
* Page fields do not support Radio lists. Workaround: use elements.
* Need to provide homepage for project.

Reported Bugs which we can't reproduce

* "Couldn't find 'site' generator" when running watircraft command.
  (using 0.3.1, neither taza nor watircraft-beta is also installed)
