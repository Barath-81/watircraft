Known Bugs

* Can't install on mac. (This used to work.)
* The name of the element underlying each field is not consistent. In pages,
  it is called foo_field; in tables, foo_element. (Should probably be
  foo_element in both places.)
* Page fields do not support Radio lists. Workaround: use elements.
* Need to provide homepage for project.
