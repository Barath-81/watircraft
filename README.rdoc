= WatirCraft

== DESCRIPTION

WatirCraft is a testing framework that builds on Watir. 
It allows tests to be expressed as Rspec or Cucumber tests and provides 
a library structure to support maintainable testing. It gives you
a place to put things.

== FEATURES

* Generate a directory structure for your test suite with one command.
* Provides page adapters you can customize for your application.
* Configure application URL and browser type (IE, Firefox) in one location.
* Framework automatically initializes browser for testing.

== APPROACH

WatirCraft is an object-oriented testing framework that helps you create
class libraries to support the tests for your application. On their own,
many testers have created procedural libraries for testing because they
understand these and find them easier to create and understand.

Although object-oriented frameworks like WatirCraft are somewhat more difficult
to understand at first, they are easier to customize and upgrade. As we add
more features to the WatirCraft framework, your test suite will automatically
get the benefit.

== INSTALL

* gem install watircraft

== EXAMPLE

An example test suite for this framework can be found in the framework
