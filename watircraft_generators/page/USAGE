Description:
  
  A page class collects elements that grouped together. Usually they all 
  appear on the same physical page. But you can also use page classes for 
  parts of a page, or for items which appear on many pages. 

Examples:

  script\generate page "check out"
  script\generate page header
  script\generate page CheckOut
